# microbePCA
Looking for a PCA to replicate, ideally involving microbial community structure. 

For current PDF report go to Prog_Report.microbePCA.11.29.20.pdf 

To run the code yourself go to Prog_Report.microbePCA.11.29.20.Rmd

That Rmarkdown file contains multiple, originally separate scripts for running the PCAs. I've consolidated them into one Rmd file and have finally got the directories sorted out so you can run the PCAs all in this Rmd file. The scripts require many of the other files in this repository to run, so make sure to PULL the full repository down to be sure you've got everything. Lots of code.

The original publication is here as well, see the file: s41598-018-37208-z.pdf
